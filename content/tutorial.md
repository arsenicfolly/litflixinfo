Welcome to [LitFlix]! Here, you can watch all the shows and all the movies in the highest quality possible. We aim to have the largest media collection out of all our competitors while giving you the best user experience. LitFlix is powered by you -- yes, you -- from the movies and TV Shows you [request] through our site! We are a small but dedicated team, so we would love to hear your feedback and hang out with us anonymously through our [SimpleX] group chat.

# Requesting

[request] as much movies and TV shows to your heart's content! This streaming platform is built by you, and that's what makes LitFlix unique. Requests are typically handled and fulfilled within 1 to 2 business days. 

# Reporting media

If you notice anything strange with any of the media (wrong subtitles, bad quality movie, or a movie that won't load), you can report the media through the [request] site! Simply search the movie or TV show that has the anomaly and click the yellow button "Report an Issue." Or, you can notify us through our [SimpleX] chat. Either way, thanks in advance for making the viewing experience better for everyone!

# Password Sharing

Share your password, we don't care! Don't share it to too much people, however, since it will interfere with the saved locations on the shows you're watching. Also, streams are limited to only one device at a time per user account. Invite your friends to join LitFlix instead :)
